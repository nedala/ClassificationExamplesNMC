To perform server-side comparisons between two large tables in Snowflake to ensure their similarity in various aspects such as counts, null presence, and data distribution, you can employ several SQL-based strategies. These strategies are designed to efficiently utilize Snowflake's capabilities without the need to transfer data to an external tool like pandas. Here's a guide to setting up these checks using Snowflake SQL:

### 1. **Row Counts**

First, ensure that both tables have the same number of rows:

```sql
SELECT
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1) AS count_table1,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table2) AS count_table2;
```

### 2. **Column-Wise Null Counts**

Check for differences in the number of NULLs in each column:

```sql
SELECT
  'table1' AS table_name,
  column_name,
  COUNT(*) - COUNT(column_name) AS null_count
FROM table1
GROUP BY column_name
UNION ALL
SELECT
  'table2' AS table_name,
  column_name,
  COUNT(*) - COUNT(column_name) AS null_count
FROM table2
GROUP BY column_name;
```

### 3. **Data Distribution**

For numeric columns, you can compare basic statistics like minimum, maximum, average, and standard deviation. For categorical columns, you might compare the distribution of top values.

**Numeric columns example**:

```sql
SELECT
  'table1' AS table_name,
  column_name,
  MIN(column_name) AS min_val,
  MAX(column_name) AS max_val,
  AVG(column_name) AS avg_val,
  STDDEV(column_name) AS stddev_val
FROM table1
GROUP BY column_name
UNION ALL
SELECT
  'table2' AS table_name,
  column_name,
  MIN(column_name),
  MAX(column_name),
  AVG(column_name),
  STDDEV(column_name)
FROM table2
GROUP BY column_name;
```

**Categorical columns example**:

```sql
SELECT
  'table1' AS table_name,
  column_name,
  value,
  COUNT(*) AS frequency
FROM table1,
LATERAL FLATTEN(input => column_name)
GROUP BY column_name, value
UNION ALL
SELECT
  'table2' AS table_name,
  column_name,
  value,
  COUNT(*)
FROM table2,
LATERAL FLATTEN(input => column_name)
GROUP BY column_name, value;
```

### 4. **Full Row Comparison**

For a more thorough check, you might consider comparing hash values of entire rows to spot differences in any rows.

```sql
SELECT HASH(*), COUNT(*) FROM table1 GROUP BY 1
EXCEPT
SELECT HASH(*), COUNT(*) FROM table2 GROUP BY 1;
```

### 5. **Information Schema**

Although `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` provides metadata, it does not offer data content statistics. For column existence and data type comparison:

```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'TABLE1'
EXCEPT
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'TABLE2';
```

### 6. **Using Snowflake Features for Advanced Data Profiling**

While Snowflake doesn't provide built-in data profiling functions like some other platforms, you can use third-party tools integrated with Snowflake or Snowflake's support for creating User Defined Functions (UDFs) or stored procedures to extend your data profiling capabilities.

### Conclusion

Using these SQL queries, you can effectively perform most of the required checks directly in Snowflake, ensuring that your analysis remains server-side and scalable. Adjust the queries
